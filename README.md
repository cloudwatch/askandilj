- 👋 Hi, While I’m still @kandilj the original committer, I also use @cloudwatch for commercial client work and startups after I left fulltime employment at *Bazaarvoice*.
- 👀 I’m still interested in learning about new frameworks, but also and how to run websites and dev environments more safely.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more advanced coding techniques and configurations. I am also actively continuing to design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on *paid projects only*.
- 📫 How to reach me, use my website https://dalyakandil.me
